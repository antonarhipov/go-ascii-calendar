# Enhanced Requirements Document

## Introduction
This document specifies the functional and non-functional requirements for an advanced terminal-based (CLI/CUI) calendar application for comprehensive event management. Upon launch, the application displays three calendar months side-by-side (previous, current, next) with enhanced navigation, search capabilities, and sophisticated event management features. Users can navigate using both vim-style keys and arrow keys, perform inline event operations, search through events, and customize application behavior through configuration files.

The application supports JSON-based data persistence with automatic migration from legacy formats, configuration management through files and command-line options, real-time input validation, and enhanced visual feedback including color support with monochrome terminal compatibility.

The intended environment is a standard terminal with keyboard-driven interaction, supporting both basic monochrome terminals and modern color-enabled terminals.

## Enhanced Requirements

### Requirement 1: Three-Month Calendar Display with Enhanced Visual Indicators
- **User Story**: As a user, I want to see the previous, current, and next months side-by-side at startup with clear visual indicators for today, selected dates, and event-containing days so that I can immediately understand the temporal context and event distribution.
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
    - WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL render three calendar months side-by-side showing the previous, current, and next months relative to the system's local date.
    - WHEN rendering a month THEN the system SHALL show day-of-week headers with color coding (cyan in color terminals) and align date numbers under the correct weekdays.
    - WHEN today's date is within the three displayed months THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish it with bright yellow text in color terminals or bold formatting in monochrome terminals.
    - WHEN a day is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight it with blue background and white text in color terminals or reverse video in monochrome terminals.
    - WHEN a day contains events THEN the system SHALL indicate this with green text color in color terminals while maintaining readability in monochrome terminals.
    - WHEN a day is both today and selected THEN the system SHALL combine visual indicators with bright cyan background and white bold text.
    - WHEN the terminal size is at least 80x24 characters THEN the system SHALL render the three-month view without truncation.
    - WHEN events exist for the selected date THEN the system SHALL display up to 10 events in a dedicated section below the calendar, aligned with the calendar's left edge.

### Requirement 2: Dual Navigation System with Enhanced Movement
