   - [x] Create functions for positioning three months side-by-side

8. [x] Develop visual indicators and highlighting
   - [x] Implement today's date highlighting
   - [x] Create selected day visual indication
   - [x] Add event indicators for days with events
   - [x] Handle combined states (today + selected, selected + events)
   - [x] Ensure ASCII-safe characters and monochrome compatibility

## Phase 4 Input Handling & Navigation

9. [x] Build keyboard input processing system
