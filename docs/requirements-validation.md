## Requirement 1: Three-Month Calendar Display on Startup ✅

**User Story**: As a user, I want to see the previous, current, and next months side-by-side at startup.

### Acceptance Criteria Validation:

✅ **WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL render three calendar months side-by-side**
- Implementation: `terminal/renderer.go` - `RenderCalendar()` function renders three months
- Verified: Application displays current-1, current, current+1 months on startup

✅ **WHEN rendering a month THEN the system SHALL show day-of-week headers and align date numbers**
- Implementation: `calendar/utils.go` - Month layout and day alignment functions
- Verified: Proper weekday headers (Sun-Sat) and date number alignment under correct days

✅ **WHEN today's date is within the three displayed months THEN the system SHALL visually distinguish today's date**
- Implementation: `terminal/renderer.go` - Today highlighting with `[XX]` bracket format
- Verified: Today's date shows with visual distinction using ASCII-safe brackets

✅ **WHEN the terminal size is at least 80x24 characters THEN the system SHALL render without truncation**
- Implementation: `terminal/terminal.go` - `CheckSize()` function validates minimum terminal size
- Verified: Application checks terminal size on startup and displays error if too small

## Requirement 2: Day Indicators in Calendar Grid ✅

**User Story**: As a user, I want day cells to display indicators for selected day, today, or days with events.

### Acceptance Criteria Validation:

✅ **WHEN a day has one or more events THEN the system SHALL display an event indicator**
- Implementation: `terminal/renderer.go` - Event dot (•) indicator rendering
- Verified: Days with events show dot indicator using ASCII-safe bullet character

✅ **WHEN a day is selected THEN the system SHALL visually highlight the selected day's cell**
- Implementation: `models/selection.go` + `terminal/renderer.go` - Selection highlighting
- Verified: Selected day shows distinct visual highlighting

✅ **WHEN a day is both today and selected THEN the system SHALL present combined indication**
- Implementation: Combined rendering logic in `terminal/renderer.go`
- Verified: Days that are both today and selected show both indicators clearly

✅ **WHEN indicators are rendered THEN the system SHALL avoid symbols that conflict with date digits**
- Implementation: Uses brackets `[XX]`, bullet `•`, and spacing - no digit conflicts
- Verified: All indicators use ASCII-safe characters that don't interfere with date readability

## Requirement 3: Month Navigation with B/N Keys ✅

**User Story**: As a user, I want to navigate the three-month window backward or forward by month.

### Acceptance Criteria Validation:

✅ **WHEN the user presses 'B' or 'b' THEN the system SHALL shift the three-month window backward**
- Implementation: `terminal/navigation.go` - `NavigateMonthBackward()` function

✅ **WHEN the user presses 'J' or 'j' THEN the system SHALL move the selection one week down**
- Implementation: `terminal/navigation.go` - `NavigateDayDown()` function (+7 days)
- Verified: J/j moves down one week, stays within visible three-month range

✅ **WHEN a movement would go beyond the visible three-month window THEN the system SHALL keep selection at boundary**
- Implementation: Boundary checking logic in navigation functions
- Verified: Selection constrained to visible range; user must use B/N for further navigation

- Verified: Accepts HH:MM format, validates time ranges (00:00-23:59)

✅ **WHEN the time input is invalid THEN the system SHALL inform the user and re-prompt**
- Implementation: Error handling and validation with user feedback
- Verified: Invalid time formats show error message and allow retry

✅ **WHEN prompted for description THEN the system SHALL accept non-empty text line**
- Implementation: Description validation prevents empty entries
